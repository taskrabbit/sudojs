# sudo.js

## Overview

High-level, "Model/View" (or "Presentation Model") style object oriented library made to aide you in your quest for Javascript
awesomeness by assisting with such things as implementing inheritance patterns, handling data-mutation observation,
establishing hierarchies of objects which have intrinsic knowledge of their responsibilies, and the making of sandwiches.

## Documentaion

- Specific `module` documentation and examples moved to [the wiki](https://github.com/taskrabbit/sudojs/wiki).
- See the Docco annotated source code located in the docs directory.
- Utilize the patterns and best practices docs in the [TechRabbit Blog](http://tech.taskrabbit.com/)

## Test Suite

The `specRunner.html` file in `root` runs each individual module's specs. Load it as a file in your browser of
choice or, if you have Node.js installed you can `npm install node-static` then `node staticServer.js` which will
serve the spec runner at `localhost:5678/specRunner.html`. This is useful, for me at least, for x-platform
testing as I can just point virtual machines at the host. Note that individual spec files can be run from here as well, just
adjust the path accordingly. The `sudo.Base` module for example could be run at `localhost:5678/base/specRunner.html`

Also note that the `lib/jquery` folder in no way indicates a dependency on _that_ particular version of `jQuery`. It
is there simply so I can run tests offline (which I usually write while riding Caltrain [no wifi]).

## Rails Gem

A rather opinionated gem is available [here](https://github.com/robrobbins/sudojs-rails). More than just making sudo builds
(sudo and sudo-x) available for your rails apps it enforces a rather unique workflow. More info there...

## Node.js Module

A simplified version of `sudo.js` is available for Node:
    
    npm install sudoclass

It provides `sudo.js` style inheritance, key-value coding (the `sudo.js Base Object`), delegation, and data-mutation-observation via
the `Observable` extension. The `sudo.js` build tool is built with this.

## Build Tool

The latest concatonated (but unminified) version of `sudo.js` (and `sudo-x.js` [sudo.js with added stuff]) is always
located in `build/debug`. If you are making changes, adding new modules, or creating a custom build and need the `debug/`
files to be rebuilt `cd` into the `build/lib` directory and run:

    node run.js [0.x.x] [sudo.html] [sudo-x.html] [foo.html] ...

Note that the `foo.html` above would represent an HTML configuration file you created for a custom build of sudo.js.

You will need `Node.js` installed as well as the `sudoclass` module mentioned above. The arguments that follow the invocation of
`run.js` are a _version number_ and the html files that the build tool uses to load the 'modules'. If you are adding new 'modules'
be sure to add them to sudo.html (and/or the sudo-x.html) config file or they will not be added to the concatonated `debug/` file(s).

### Extras

The debug version, `build/debug/sudo.js`, contains the basic 'modules' as well as the others located in the `extras` directory that have been
tested and documented. A basic build is also available (`sudo-basic`), this serves as an example of how to configure a custom build of
`sudo.js` if desired.
